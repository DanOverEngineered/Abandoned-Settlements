# Abandoned-Settlements

This is a complete overhaul of my Abandoned Settlements mod, available on the [Steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2310821218).

This was my first attempt at writing an MES expansion and while popular, I will be the first to admit it has issues.  This rewrite aims to simplify updates, eliminate a number of branches to support thrid-party mods and greatly improve progression and balance.
